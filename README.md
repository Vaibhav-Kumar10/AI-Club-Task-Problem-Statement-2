Iris Species Classification (Classification)

Problem Statement: Classify iris flowers into one of the three species based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width using K-Nearest Neighbors

Solution Approach:
1.Load the Iris dataset using load_iris from sklearn.datasets.
2.Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Train a classifier : KNN, on the training set.

Hint:
Dive deep into sklearn libraries below
sklearn.model_selection 
sklearn.neighbors 
sklearn.metrics 

Note 
1. Evaluate the classifier on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
2. Visualise the results, using standard visualisation tools and Find the best Metric for the problem
